This is a black-and-white version of the
[NotoColorEmoji](https://github.com/googlei18n/noto-emoji) font.  It
can be useful for printing, or on platforms that do not support color
fonts.

When you change this black-and-white font, please keep the glyph
metrics (especially the advance width) and the overall design style in
sync with the [SVG sources for the color glyphs](https://github.com/googlefonts/noto-emoji/tree/main/svg).
