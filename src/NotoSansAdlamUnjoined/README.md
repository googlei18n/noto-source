# Noto Sans Adlam Unjoined

Noto Sans Adlam is the un-connected version of the Adlam script.
This repository contains version 3.x which is a redesign by Mark Jamra and Neil Patel (JamraPatel).
The intent of version 3.x is to create a design which pairs better with Noto Latin in style.
The design was reviewed by Abdoulaye and Ibrahima Barry.

## Build Notes

Version 3.x of Noto Sans Adlam is developed to be built using fontamke and a Glyphs source file.
The AFDKO `.fea` file is included as a reference, but the code is in the Glyphs file and so can be generated from Glyphs. 
The pre-existing FontDame files are no longer required.

### Test Font build commands

    fontmake -g NotoSansAdlamUnjoined.glyphs
    
    fontmake -g NotoSansAdlamUnjoined.glyphs -o variable
    
    ttfautohint -f adlm NotoSansAdlamUnjoined-Regular.ttf NotoSansAdlamUnjoined-Regular_autohint.ttf  
    
    ttfautohint -f adlm NotoSansAdlamUnjoined-Bold.ttf NotoSansAdlamUnjoined-Bold_autohint.ttf  

### Special Notes on Kerning

It seems every application used for testing treats the Adlam numerals like they are Arabic numerals, in that it expects them to run left-to-right.
As a result, any kerning that is applied to the numerals gets flipped to the opposite side.
Therefore, a few kerning pairs have been left out of the numerals because they would look bad in most applications.

The newer version of Glyphs (1230/1271) injects the `adlm` script tag in the kerning table, which doesn't seem to be reliably recognized by most apps.
The work-around employed is to remove the `adlm` tag from the `LanguageSystems` entry.
This suppresses the script tag in the table and makes the kerning work for the letters.
