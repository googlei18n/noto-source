    An [1;97;101mERROR[0m is something wrong with FontBakery itself, possibly a bug.
    A [1;91;107mFAIL[0m is a problem with the font that must be fixed.
    A [1;30;103mWARN[0m is something that you should consider addressing.
    An [0;36;107mINFO[0m result simply prints something useful. Typically stats.
    A [0;32;107mPASS[0m means the font looks good for the given checking routine.
    And a [0;34;107mSKIP[0m happens when the check does not apply to the given font.
