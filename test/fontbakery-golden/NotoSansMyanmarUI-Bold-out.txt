    [1;30;107mMeaning of check results:[0m

    An [1;97;101mERROR[0m is something wrong with FontBakery itself, possibly a bug.
    A [1;91;107mFAIL[0m is a problem with the font that must be fixed.
    A [1;30;103mWARN[0m is something that you should consider addressing.
    An [0;36;107mINFO[0m result simply prints something useful. Typically stats.
    A [0;32;107mPASS[0m means the font looks good for the given checking routine.
    And a [0;34;107mSKIP[0m happens when the check does not apply to the given font.

    If you get [1;97;101mERROR[0ms, please help us improve the tool by reporting them at
    [1;36;107mhttps://github.com/googlefonts/fontbakery/issues[0m

    (but other kinds of bug reports and/or
     feature requests are also always welcome, of course!)
