E <bounds/glyph/ymax> Real yMax for glyph 101 (oeSign_auSign_cham) is 1341, which is higher than the font's sTypoAscent (1117), resulting in clipping.
E <bounds/glyph/ymax> Real yMax for glyph 102 (auSign_mSignFinal_cham) is 1283, which is higher than the font's sTypoAscent (1117), resulting in clipping.
E <bounds/glyph/ymax> Real yMax for glyph 103 (oeSign_ngSignFinal_cham) is 1192, which is higher than the font's sTypoAscent (1117), resulting in clipping.
E <bounds/glyph/ymin> Real yMin for glyph 128 (raMedial_cham_pre) is -366, which is lower than the font's sTypoDescent (-351), resulting in clipping.
