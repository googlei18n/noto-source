E <bounds/glyph/ymax> Real yMax for glyph 1510 (uni1E4C) is 1072, which is higher than the font's sTypoAscent (1069), resulting in clipping.
E <bounds/glyph/ymin> Real yMin for glyph 2482 (scriptg) is -389, which is lower than the font's sTypoDescent (-293), resulting in clipping.
E <bounds/glyph/ymin> Real yMin for glyph 2644 (uni2E10) is -298, which is lower than the font's sTypoDescent (-293), resulting in clipping.
E <bounds/glyph/ymin> Real yMin for glyph 2672 (uni2E11) is -298, which is lower than the font's sTypoDescent (-293), resulting in clipping.
E <bounds/glyph/ymin> Real yMin for glyph 2705 (uni2E3E) is -309, which is lower than the font's sTypoDescent (-293), resulting in clipping.
E <bounds/glyph/ymin> Real yMin for glyph 3208 (uniA670) is -297, which is lower than the font's sTypoDescent (-293), resulting in clipping.
E <bounds/glyph/ymin> Real yMin for glyph 3210 (uniA672) is -305, which is lower than the font's sTypoDescent (-293), resulting in clipping.
E <bounds/font/ymax> Real yMax 1072, but it should be less than or equal to the value of Ascent in 'hhea' table, which is 1069.
E <bounds/font/ymin> Real yMin is -389, but it should be greater than or equal to the value of Descent in 'hhea' table, which is -293.
