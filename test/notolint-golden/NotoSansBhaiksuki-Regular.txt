Automatic testing for 'instance_ttf,NotoSansBhaiksuki-Regular.ttf', Version 2.001:
E <bounds/glyph/ymin> Real yMin for glyph 99 (Dbhya) is -491, which is lower than the font's sTypoDescent (-460), resulting in clipping.
E <bounds/glyph/ymin> Real yMin for glyph 101 (Dbu) is -531, which is lower than the font's sTypoDescent (-460), resulting in clipping.
E <bounds/glyph/ymin> Real yMin for glyph 146 (Dvru) is -532, which is lower than the font's sTypoDescent (-460), resulting in clipping.
E <bounds/glyph/ymin> Real yMin for glyph 147 (Dvya) is -474, which is lower than the font's sTypoDescent (-460), resulting in clipping.
E <bounds/glyph/ymin> Real yMin for glyph 395 (Ngggra) is -475, which is lower than the font's sTypoDescent (-460), resulting in clipping.
E <bounds/glyph/ymin> Real yMin for glyph 470 (Ntrye) is -630, which is lower than the font's sTypoDescent (-460), resulting in clipping.
E <bounds/glyph/ymin> Real yMin for glyph 707 (Ssttya) is -461, which is lower than the font's sTypoDescent (-460), resulting in clipping.
E <bounds/font/ymin> Real yMin is -630, but it should be greater than or equal to the value of Descent in 'hhea' table, which is -460.
